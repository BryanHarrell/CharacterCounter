# CharacterCounter
Simple character counter for proofreaders with a lot of docx that need to be calculated.


As proofreaders, we often have to proof multiple docx, this tool allows you to calculate the character count in one go.
You can either download the Counter.py file and put it in the directory with your docx, or download the mac os x executable here

Which you can place in the same directory.

Roadmap:
Add integration to copy all documents into one file, suitable for agencies that need to check your calculations
Add Gmail integration to be able to connect to your gmail, download relevant attachments into one folder
Add header and footer counts
